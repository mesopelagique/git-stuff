## How to activate github page to your project 

Go to Settings, go down to Github Pages section and choose to active github pages.

The link to your github page will be written but if not the link is https://user.github.io/repo (with user your username, repo your repository name)

## Customize theme

You can choose a theme just in the same section where you activate the page.
